# History of Nintendo

History of Nintendo has been designed for researchers and those interested in seeing a succint breakdown of the history of the video game company Nintendo. It will be useful as it strikes a balance between being easily accessable, and having all the key dates related to the history of the company. Most websites either contain a lot of information making it difficult to find key dates related to the company, or can be vague, missing out events or glossing over key moments. This website strives to meet a middle ground between these two elements.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The Navigation Bar is visible across all three pages and features links to the Logo, Home Page, Timeline, and the Newsletter signup page. It is identical on each page to assist navigation.
  - This allows users to easily traverse the website without having to use outside sources
  - It also includes hower-over text to help with accessability and bold icons to make the meaning clear as to what each page provides
  - On smaller devices (less than 420px), the titles of each page dissapear leaving only the icons. This is to make sure that the header does not become too cramped and is still useable on smaller screens.

- __Introduction__

  - The introduction text provides the user with information about what the page is about and who it is for. 
  - It acts as a hook to bring users in who may be interested in the information provided within the page.

- __Gallery__

  - The Gallery is on the Home Page as it features all the key moments and consoles within Nintendo's history.
  - This allows users to visably see the history of Nintendo through images
  - On smaller screens (less than 576px), the images are actually in chronological order related to the timeline on the other page. However, on larger screens, the images appear in columns so that these images do not take up the entire width of the page and waste space.

- __Footer__

  - The footer includes icons that link to different social media websites, including Facebook, Twitter/X, Reddit and YouTube.
  - It also features hover-over text for accessablity and opens the pages in new tabs to stream line user experience and make sure they do not have to constantly click on the back button to reutrn to the original page.
  - I specifically chose these social media pages as they all provide platforms for users to hold discussions, or find more information, unlike sites like Instagram or Snapchat, which I did not think would be suitable for a page of this style.

- __Timeline__
