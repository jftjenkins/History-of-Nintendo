# History of Nintendo

History of Nintendo has been designed for researchers and those interested in seeing a succint breakdown of the history of the video game company Nintendo. It will be useful as it strikes a balance between being easily accessable, and having all the key dates related to the history of the company. Most websites either contain a lot of information making it difficult to find key dates related to the company, or can be vague, missing out events or glossing over key moments. This website strives to meet a middle ground between these two elements.
