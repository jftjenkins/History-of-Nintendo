# History of Nintendo

History of Nintendo has been designed for researchers and those interested in seeing a succint breakdown of the history of the video game company Nintendo. It will be useful as it strikes a balance between being easily accessable, and having all the key dates related to the history of the company. Most websites either contain a lot of information making it difficult to find key dates related to the company, or can be vague, missing out events or glossing over key moments. This website strives to meet a middle ground between these two elements.

## Features

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The Navigation Bar is visible across all three pages and features links to the Logo, Home Page, Timeline, and the Newsletter signup page. It is identical on each page to assist navigation.
  - This allows users to easily traverse the website without having to use outside sources
  - It also includes hower-over text to help with accessability and bold icons to make the meaning clear as to what each page provides
  - On smaller devices (less than 420px), the titles of each page dissapear leaving only the icons. This is to make sure that the header does not become too cramped and is still useable on smaller screens.
