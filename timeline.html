                Nintendo releases one of its most recognisable consoles to date:
                the <i>Wii</i>. It instantly becomes a fast seller with its
                unique motion controls, being advertised as accessible to all
                age groups and casual gamers, making it a popular family gift
                for the Christmas season.

                is able to create 3D effects without the use of special glasses.

                The <i>Wii U</i> is released, the successor to the <i>Wii</i>.
                It is one of Nintendo’s worst performing consoles selling just
                over 13 million units over its lifetime. Its failure is seen as
                being due to a confusing marketing campaign, lack of third-party
                support, lack of games when it launched, and a high price point.

                The <i>Nintendo Switch Lite</i> is released. It is a ‘budget’
                version of the original <i>Switch</i> that is purely handheld.
                It does not feature the Joycons and is not able to use the dock
                featured with the <i>Switch</i>. However, it still sells well
                and is considered a success.
